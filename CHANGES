v0.2.3  --  2013.02.13
Two crucial fixes to v0.2 branch:
* Fix entry script path in package.json
* Do not use Object.freeze (it was used wrong way and broke implementation).
  We weren't aware of that as older version of V8 didn't support Object.freeze

v0.2.2  --  2012.06.13
* Quick fix for totally broken v0.2.1. Mistakenly published package that was not
  fully updated up to changes in es5-ext projectw.

* Update up to v0.8 branch of es5-ext

* Return builder object not just `build` function. Allows better customization
* Templetes can be imported via custom `require` function
* In html5 mode mark function (on*) attributes with string value as well so they
  can be picked up by CSS rules easily

* Support for null or undefined as argument (it's ignored then)
* Expose all functions on `_map` property
* String argument as optional in `_text`, `_comment` and `_cdata` methods
